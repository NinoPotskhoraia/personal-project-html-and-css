# personal-project-html-and-css

In TBC IT Academy front-end bootcamps I was given an assignment to complete the whole layout in 5 days, using HTML and vanilaa CSS and replicate an xd file pixel by pixel, using Pixel Perfect Chrome Extension. which I successfully accomplished and got the highest acclaim for my work.
Later on I added firebase hosting to provide live Demo of the project.
